when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when I want to share my project with people or work with somebody in a a project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
if somebody else do that chenges and I didn't like it I want to discuse it with him then I can pull it
